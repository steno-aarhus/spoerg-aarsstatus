<!--
The "code" for adding a "profile-picture" (which is an image with
rounded corners) has the same elements as the image example above, but 
with a different class in the `{}` part, namely `.profile-picture`.

The `text-center` part is a class that centers the image text on the page,
which is the text in the `[]` part. 

You can remove `text-center` along
with the `:::` before and after the image if you want the text to be
left-aligned.
